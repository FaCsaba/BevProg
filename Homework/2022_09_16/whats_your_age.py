# Excersize in getting input from a user and using an if statement
# Ask the user for their age and based on that write out if they can:
#   - legally drink in the United States of America
#   - can legally buy cigarette products in Hungary
#   - can legally obtain a drivers license in Hungary
#   - can watch Shrek 2, a film rated for 12 and above

# Caveats: excersize did not specify if we are only allowed to display a single fact,
# I choose to interpret that as we may choose to display these facts as they come
